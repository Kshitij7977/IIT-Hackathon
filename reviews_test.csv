Globally the company is known to provide great work life balance opportunities, in India they have introduced  some changes in 2017 which makes working in India difficult.  Focus in on spending 9.5 hours in office even if you are currently not involved in delivery. productivity does not matter at all. Work From Home is common for European colleagues but if you raise the topic with Indian manager they will react as if a huge calamity has struck them

Crazy travel policy , while I can understand no business class for Managers was shocked to see that there is no business travel option for Senior Manager, Associate Director and even Directors.
